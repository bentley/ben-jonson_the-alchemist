								<span>Come on, sir. Now, you set your foot on shore</span>
								<br/>
								<span>In Novo Orbe; here’s the rich Peru:</span>
								<br/>
								<span>And there within, sir, are the golden mines,</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Great Solomon’s Ophir! he was sailing to’t,</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Three years, but we have reached it in ten months.</span>
								<br/>
								<span>This is the day, wherein, to all my friends,</span>
								<br/>
								<span>I will pronounce the happy word, <em>Be Rich</em>;</span>
								<br/>
								<span><em>This day you shall be spectatissimi</em>.</span>
								<br/>
								<span>You shall no more deal with the hollow dye,</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Or the frail card. No more be at charge of keeping</span>
								<br/>
								<span>The livery-punk for the young heir, that must</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Seal, at all hours, in his shirt: no more,</span>
								<br/>
								<span>If he deny, have him beaten to’t, as he is</span>
								<br/>
								<span>That brings him the commodity. No more</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Shall thirst of satin, or the covetous hunger</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Of velvet entrails for a rude-spun cloke,</span>
								<br/>
								<span>To be display’d at madam Augusta’s, make</span>
								<br/>
								<span>The sons of Sword and Hazard fall before</span>
								<br/>
								<span>The golden calf, and on their knees, whole nights</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Commit idolatry with wine and trumpets:</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Or go a feasting after drum and ensign.</span>
								<br/>
								<span>No more of this. You shall start up young viceroys,</span>
								<br/>
								<span>And have your punks, and punketees, my Surly.</span>
								<br/>
								<span>And unto thee I speak it first, <em>Be Rich</em>.</span>
