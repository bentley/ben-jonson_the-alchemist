			<p>
				<span>Fortune, that favours fools, these two short hours,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">We wish away, both for your sakes and ours,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Judging spectators; and desire, in place,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">To the author justice, to ourselves but grace.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Our scene is London, ‘cause we would make known,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">No country’s mirth is better than our own:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>No clime breeds better matter for your whore,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Bawd, squire, impostor, many persons more,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Whose manners, now call’d humours, feed the stage;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And which have still been subject for the rage</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Or spleen of comic writers. Though this pen </span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Did never aim to grieve, but better men;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Howe’er the age he lives in doth endure</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">The vices that she breeds, above their cure.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>But when the wholesome remedies are sweet,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And in their working gain and profit meet,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>He hopes to find no spirit so much diseased,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">But will with such fair correctives be pleased:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>For here he doth not fear who can apply.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">If there be any that will sit so nigh</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Unto the stream, to look what it doth run,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">They shall find things, they’d think or wish were done;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>They are so natural follies, but so shewn,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">As even the doers may see, and yet not own.</span>
